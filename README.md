# WHERE IS THE COFFEE? ☕️

An iOS app that allows you to look for coffee shops in your area or any area you may want to look in. With this app you will be able to see the reviews of each coffee shop as well as ratings, if they are open or closed as well as the address of the company.

For the future of this application I would love to give the app some more functionality such as stories, post as well as group chats.

## API Reference

API's that I used were the Google API for the searching capability as well as the Yelp API to pull in the information for what ever city was given.
